        <h3>behavior and description</h3>
        <p> The Co-Co Bird, or 1387, is a tall, bony humanoid with black and gray stretched skin, a long neck, and a bird-like head. Its bite force is around 1,753 PSI. We were only able to test this once due to several complications, but with proper funding, we can explore it further. Its height is 10.6 feet, and its age is estimated to be over 25,300 years. This can be investigated further and sent to Bio C3 for additional testing. We do not know its origins before a certain point the earliest records trace it to Europe and Asia, suggesting it may be a migratory species.
Behavior:
Stage 1: It remains in a sleep-like state until transitioning to Stage 2 or being abruptly awakened, at which point it becomes extremely violent. This violent state lasts between 30 to 80 minutes. The sleep state typically lasts for 3 to 5 months.
Stage 2: It awakens and begins searching for prey. When it finds prey, it moves its neck in a way that produces a clicking sound, funneling the noise so that only the prey can hear it. We do not yet understand how this is achieved, but further research is planned. It stays distant in this stage unless the prey is alone, in which case it remains stationary and continues clicking. This stage lasts 6 to 8 months.
Stage 3: It remains close to its prey, often just 1 to 2 feet away. In crowds, it somehow becomes invisible to everyone except the prey. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing. This stage lasts for approximately 3 weeks.
Stage 4: It begins making noises and becomes visible to everyone. It stands fully upright or hides in room corners, often clinging to walls. When the prey is about 50 feet away, it sprints at speeds of up to 49 mph. This stage lasts anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 day.
Stage 5: It stops clicking and approaches the prey, using its strong jaws and bird-like arms to attack. Most subjects remain alive for nearly the entire process before it reverts to Stage 1. We have not yet tested what happens when i goes without food for an extended period, but we suspect it would enter a modified super-violent state. </p>

        <p>Safety is one of our highest priorities. Because of this, we have added multiple precautions to ensure a secure environment. These include half a foot of concrete, 3-inch tempered one-way glass, a constant supply of food, two armed guards, cameras, and a tracking chip. I will walk you through our containment breach procedure.
First, if a breach occurs through the door, immediately lock all doors leading to the rest of B.R.E. Do not hesitate to lock yourself or your coworkers in. Then, alert an S.4.25, S.5.13, or S.4.39 team, depending on the type of attack. These teams are specially trained to handle this specific threat. Once the situation is contained, janitors will clean the area, and maintenance teams M-14, M-28, or M-23 specifically trained for this enclosure will repair any damage.
If the breach occurs through the window, sensors will automatically lock the door to prevent further breaches. The previously mentioned teams will respond accordingly. If the creature reaches B.R.E., S-B.5.8 will be deployed. If that fails, the area will be sealed, and CO2, hydrogen, or helium will be pumped in. Mustard gas is also being considered as a contingency.
Additionally, staff are trained to recognize signs of an impending containment breach. Always check the cameras before opening a door. If the creature is looking through the one-way glass at you or a coworker, immediately inform the enclosure manager and vacate the lab room. If it enters a super-violent state, notify the manager and step away from any glass or doors. Any threat to yourself, your coworkers, or property should be reported to the manager immediately.</p>

        <p>we do have some plans on how to use it and if<br> are team of the best engineers can do it are profits <br>will be big </p>

        <p>We have several hopes for its use, primarily in eliminating threats, assassinations, and general wartime operations. THIS ENTITY CAN ONLY BE SOLD TO GOVERNMENTS, NOT PRIVATE ENTITIES. We are still working on a method to make it lock onto an individual. Tests have shown that it only locks onto something it sees. It can be prevented from locking onto an individual by covering them with a bag. If the targeted individual dies, the entity reverts to Stage 1.
Our engineers have developed a mask that can remotely direct its gaze and force it to lock onto a target. This entity was chosen due to its tough skin, which is nearly bulletproof, and its ability to become invisible.
Our starting asking price is $15,000,000 not a bad deal considering its potential military applications.</p>
